          We would like to give a HUGE thank you to all of our playtesters over the past couple years. Sky Strife could
          not have become the game it is today without your support, feedback, and insane amounts of matches played.

          This all started as a dream to create a game with no owner. A World with no God. It is up to you, the players,
          to mold Sky Strife in any way you choose. The possibilities are endless.
